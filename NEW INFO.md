## 27. Adzkhri RP Naval History (Canonical Summary)

### The Adzkhri Maritime Campaigns

During the Adzkhri conflicts, the Xana Naval Forces executed layered sea control operations to prevent encirclement of the Xana Majesty’s Territories. The RXN spearheaded decisive carrier-based strikes against Adzkhri forward maritime bastions, while the XNN enforced extended blockade, convoy defense, and colonial resupply operations.

Key Outcomes:

* Establishment of permanent RXN forward operating seas
* Validation of carrier density doctrine
* Expansion of XNN subsurface warfare mandate

The Adzkhri RP conflicts formally codified the **dual-navy doctrine** now central to Xana naval strategy.

---

## 28. Final Canon Definition

The Xana Naval Forces represent a deliberately divided yet strategically unified maritime instrument of imperial power. Through the elite strike authority of the Royal Xana Navy and the enduring control of the Xana National Navy, the Empire maintains command of the seas across peace and war alike.
